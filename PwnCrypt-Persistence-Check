## **4️⃣ PwnCrypt-Persistence-Check (`README.md`)**
### **📌 Purpose:**  
This repository checks whether **attackers established persistence**, ensuring long-term access to the compromised machine.

# 🔄 PwnCrypt Persistence Check

## 🔍 Overview
This report investigates **registry modifications and scheduled tasks** to determine whether the ransomware attempted persistence.

## 📌 Query Used
### **Registry Check:**
```kql
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where DeviceName == "win-10-25a"
| where RegistryKey contains "Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run"
| order by Timestamp desc

Scheduled Task Check:

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "win-10-25a"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "schtasks"
| order by Timestamp desc


🔎 Findings
No registry modifications were found, meaning the attacker did not attempt persistence via startup keys.
No scheduled tasks were detected, indicating this was a one-time attack rather than an ongoing compromise.
⚠ Implications
The attack focused solely on encryption and exfiltration.
No long-term persistence mechanisms were installed.
🛡 Mitigation & Recommendations
Regularly audit registry changes for unauthorized modifications.
Monitor scheduled tasks to detect stealthy persistence techniques.
Use endpoint security tools to prevent unauthorized task scheduling.
