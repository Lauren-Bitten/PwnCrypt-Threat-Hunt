# 🔄 PwnCrypt Process Execution Analysis

## 🔍 Overview
This report investigates **process executions** linked to PwnCrypt ransomware, particularly **PowerShell activity**, which was responsible for file staging and exfiltration.

## 📌 Query Used
To identify suspicious PowerShell execution, I ran:
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "win-10-25a"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "powershell"
| order by Timestamp desc


🔎 Findings
PowerShell executed exfiltratedata.ps1, which performed:
Creation of employee data files.
Compression of data using 7zip.
Data exfiltration to an external cloud storage location.
⚠ Implications
Attackers often use PowerShell scripts to execute payloads and bypass security tools.
Unrestricted PowerShell usage allows attackers to automate exfiltration and encryption.
🛡 Mitigation & Recommendations
Enforce PowerShell Constrained Language Mode to prevent script execution.
Monitor PowerShell logs for unusual execution patterns.
Block execution of Invoke-WebRequest from unauthorized scripts.
