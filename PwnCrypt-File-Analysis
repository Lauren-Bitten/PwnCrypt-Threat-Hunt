# 🛠 PwnCrypt File Analysis

## 🔍 Overview
This report examines **suspicious file activities** on the infected system (`win-10-25a`), including **file creations, modifications, and renaming** that align with ransomware behavior.

## 📌 Query Used
To identify suspicious file activity, I ran the following query:
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "win-10-25a"
| order by Timestamp desc


🔎 Findings
Suspicious DLL (xneosecg.dll) was created in C:\Windows\Temp\, indicating potential malware execution.
Security policy files (SecurityPolicy.inf) were modified, suggesting privilege escalation attempts.
Employee data files were renamed and stored in C:\ProgramData\backup\, which is typical ransomware behavior.
⚠ Implications
The presence of xneosecg.dll suggests malware execution, possibly linked to PwnCrypt.
Renamed and modified employee data files indicate staging for encryption or exfiltration.
🛡 Mitigation & Recommendations
Monitor file integrity for unauthorized modifications.
Restrict write permissions on sensitive directories.
Deploy endpoint detection for file encryption anomalies.
